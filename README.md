**BOOK BUDDIES**
**What the project does**
This application allows users to create their own profile (which is stored into a MySQL database), search for books to add to their own libraries (using the Google Books API), view their top *book buddies* on their profile page, and to see *book buddy* suggestions based on the proximity to their location.
**Why the project is useful**
Book Buddies is a social media application that helps people, friends, and family members connect to each other through their own personal libraries.
